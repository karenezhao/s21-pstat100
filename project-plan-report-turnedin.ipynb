Background\n\nIn recent years, personal freedom has declined around the world. It can be challenging to determine which countries' citizens have the most freedom. However, we can determine which countries have the highest level of human freedom through individual indices. The [Human Freedom Index Report for 2020](https://www.cato.org/sites/cato.org/files/2021-03/human-freedom-index-2020.pdf) is co‐published by the Cato Institute and the Fraser Institute. The Human Freedom Index helps observe relationship between freedom and other socioeconomic phenomena, as well as ways in which the various dimensions of freedom interact with one another. \n\nTo determine each country's freedom rank, each country is given a score for `Personal Freedom` and `Economic Freedom`. These scores are averaged to find the `Human Freedom` score. Countries in the top quartile of freedom enjoy a significantly higher average per capita income ($\\$50,340$) than those in other quartiles; the average per capita income in the least-free quartile is $\\$7,720$.\n\nThe findings in the Human Freedom Index suggest that freedom plays an important role in human well-being, and they offer opportunities for further research into the complex ways in which freedom influences, and can be influenced by, political reigmes, economic development, and the whole range of indicators of human well-being. Also, the Human Freedom Index finds a strong relationship between human freedom and democracy. \n\nMoreover, freedom and happiness tend to be positively coorelated. The [World Happiness Report for 2020](https://happiness-report.s3.amazonaws.com/2020/WHR20.pdf) brings together the available global data on national happiness and reviewing evidence from the emerging science of happiness. The report reminds us, happiness is based on social capital, not just financial capital. In this project, we will dig more deeply into the pattern of correlation and see how it differs across cultures and aspects of freedom in 2018.

Data description","metadata":{"deepnote_cell_type":"markdown"}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"### Basic information\n\n**General description**: The `Human Freedom Index` presents the state of human freedom of 162 countries around the world based on a broad measure with the help of 79 distinct indicators that encompasses, economic, civil, and personal freedom. The `World Happiness Report` contains happiness score for 156 countries along with the factors used to explain the score.\n\n**Source**: The data in the `Human Freedom Index` is collected and compiled by Ryan Murphy. The data in the `World Happiness Report` is baesed on the Gallup World Poll.\n\nThe data are publicly available: \n> Ian Vasquez and Fred McMahon, The Human Freedom Index 2020: A Global Measurement of Personal, Civil, and Economic Freedom (Washington: Cato Institute, Fraser Institute, and the Friedrich Naumann Foundation for Freedom, 2020).\n\n> Helliwell, John F., Richard Layard, Jeffrey Sachs, and Jan-Emmanuel De Neve, eds. 2020. World Happiness Report 2020. New York: Sustainable Development Solutions Network\n\nThe full dataset can be downloaded [here](https://www.cato.org/human-freedom-index/2020) for `Human Freedom Index`, and [here](https://worldhappiness.report/ed/2020/) for `World Happiness Report`.\n\n\n**Collection methods**: The data value in the `Human Freedom Index` is obtained or caluclated through different variables based on various dataset, such as Global Terriorism Database, Gloabl Database, United Nations, CI-RIGHTS Dataset, OECD, and so on. For example, rule of law is an average and procedural justice, civil justice, and criminal justice, and each subcomponent is calculated as an average of selected Rule of Law Index subfactors. The data value in the `World Happiness Report` is evaluated from the Gallup World Poll surveys. This data is collected by asking people about life satisfaction and happiness for each country.\n\n\n**Sampling design and scope of inference**: The `Human Freedom Index` data has annual observations of freedom index for 162 countries from 2008 to 2018. Also, the `World Happiness Report` data has observations of happiness score for 156 countries from 2008 to 2018. The population is all countries existing between 2008 and 2018. The frame is all countries reporting some kind of national freedom or happiness information for some year between 2008 and 2018. The sample is equal to frame. So the frame partly overlaps population, and sample is a census of the frame. Both data are administrative data. Thus, the scope of inference is none. No information is available about the sampling design for both data.\n","metadata":{"deepnote_cell_type":"markdown"}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"### Data semantics and structure\n\n**Units and
